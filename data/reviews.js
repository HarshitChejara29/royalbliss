        "content": "Comfort Salt - I like the simplicity of the name - after all, it helps bring comfort to my aching joints and muscles. I had been using Epsom Salt Baths for sometime to help recover after sport or hiking, but was advised that this can contribute to dry skin. As I am a dry skin sufferer, particularly in the winter, I switched to using Magnesium Chloride Flakes which I also believe is better absorbed by the body than Magnesium Sulfate (Epsom Salts). This product comes in a resealable packet, and consists of fairly chunky white flakes that dissolve easily..."

        "content": "this is good stuff it dissolves so easily, I think it helps I take a bath with it sometimes when my back or legs are sore after exercising and I look forward to using it. It is not scented, it seems to cloud the water a little but not in a bad way. I think the bag is expensive especially in the smaller sizes, but I only used 2 cups (bag said I could use up to 8) and I felt like that was plenty so it will last a while. I would recommend this"

I have used as a foot soak, WOW does it work, then graduated to full body soak in the tub, my skin feels younger and looks vibrant, relaxes me for a great night sleep which I need. I highly recommend this all natural product for the older set, so glad I discovered it, has been what I needed."

I love using them in my foot bath as well as my bathtub. They really help me unwind and feel a lot better after a hard day."

        "content": "This 4 pound of Comfort Salt, Magnesium Bath Flakes is comparable to regular Epsom Salts but are slightly thick slivers of magnesium. They look a bit like broken pieces of white-ish plastic and do have sharp edges, so if using for soaking one’s body, wait for them to dissolve. Since they dissolve fairly quickly, it shouldn’t be a problem, but thought to mention it. I think for a good, substantially filled deep bath soak, this bag isn’t very economical. For foot soaks, this may be a bit more affordable. However, if.."

        "content": "I rarely get to soak in a bath. I originally intended to use this product for foot baths, but I ended up going away for a 3-day excursion with a hot tub in my room and dedicated the whole bag to the weekend. I used this product for 3 days straight. It certainly doesn't foam up as shown in the pictures, but I wasn't expecting it to based on the ingredients, so no points gone for that matter. It was nice to soak in--some added scent would have been nice. It did nothing to ease any aches or pains and I eve.."

        "content": "These Comfort Salts with Magnesium work as described. They dissolve a bit quicker than other salts I use but you can feel the benefits pretty much right away as well. Not only are they relaxing - but they ease pain, Inflammation and swelling. This 4lb bag will last 2-4 full sized baths, depending on how much you use, or probably 4-8 foot baths if you go that route. I do wish you got more for the price (or if you could use less for the same effect)."

        "content": "This quick-dissolving product is very good for an injury. Bought it to aid recovery of a sprained finger. My only caveat is that the loveliness of this product absolutely ends after a brief soak. It makes every surface it splashes on sticky, including tile. Hence, a second soak in soapy water is necessary. But if you don't mind that, these flakes are rejuvenating."

The salts dissolve really easily and it doesn't dry out your skin. I have noticed however that if I use too much magnesium it affects my, um, elimination which becomes also quite relaxed."

There is no scent to these flakes at all and they do dissolve quickly and almost completely when you add them to water. I have not tried them in the bath yet, but have done several footbaths with them and afterwards I do feel relaxed and my feet feel soft and moisturized. These flakes.."
