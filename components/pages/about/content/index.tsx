            <p>Our general manager Corey first discovered the benefits of magnesium when he was working at a fertilizer plant in the mid-1990s. He was assigned to the magnesium processing area, and he quickly noticed that his sleep quality improved dramatically. He was able to fall asleep more easily, sleep more deeply, and wake up feeling refreshed and alert.
         </p><p>
After some research, he learned that magnesium is a mineral that is essential for good health. It plays a role in over 300 biochemical reactions in the body, including muscle relaxation, nerve function, and blood pressure regulation. He also learned that magnesium is often added to bathing products because it can help to relieve muscle pain and stress.</p><p>
Corey was so impressed by the benefits of magnesium that he decided to develop his own line of magnesium bath salts. He worked with his son and a colleague to create a product that was pure, natural, and effective. They used their knowledge of the magnesium processing industry to create a bath salt that is highly bioavailable, meaning that it is easily absorbed by the skin.</p><p>
The first batch of bath salts was a hit with friends and family, so Corey decided to start selling them online. He quickly gained a following of customers who were looking for a natural way to improve their sleep, relieve stress, and boost their overall health.</p><p>
During the pandemic, Corey saw an even greater demand for his bath salts. People were looking for ways to relax and de-stress at home, and magnesium bath salts were the perfect solution. Corey was able to refine his packaging and sales process during this time, and he now ships his bath salts all over the world.</p><p>
Today, Corey is still committed to providing his customers with the highest quality magnesium bath salts. He is also looking to expand his product line to include other magnesium-based products. He believes that magnesium is a powerful mineral that can help people to live healthier and happier lives.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy our magnesium bath salts as much as we do!</p>
